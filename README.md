 An app that fetches [New York Times best sellers books](https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/books-product/1/routes/lists/best-sellers/history.json/get) while leveraging the power and simplicity of [Koin](https://doc.insert-koin.io/#/introduction) for dependency injection.
 
## Techstack 
* [Architecture][1] - A collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and
  maintainable apps. Start with classes for managing your UI component lifecycle and handling data
  persistence.
  * [Data Binding][2] - Declaratively bind observable data to UI elements.
  * [Lifecycles][3] - Create a UI that automatically responds to lifecycle events.
  * [LiveData][4] - Build data objects that notify views when the underlying database changes.
  * [Room][5] - Access app's SQLite database with in-app objects and compile-time checks.
  * [ViewModel][6] - Store UI-related data that isn't destroyed on app rotations.
* Third party
  * [Koin][7] - A pragmatic lightweight dependency injection framework for Kotlin developers.
  * [MaterialComponents][12] -  interactive building blocks for creating a user interface (beautiful interfaces :ok_hand:).
  * [Retrofit][8] - A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java
  * [Moshi][9] - A modern JSON library for Android and Java. It makes it easy to parse JSON into Java objects
  * [Kotlin Coroutines][10] for managing background threads with simplified code and reducing needs for callbacks
  *[Timber][11] logging Library
